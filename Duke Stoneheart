Duke Stoneheart (human) is the current leader of Storm Haven and the Elenathian Navy. He is a young, somewhat carefree man, and while he is an excellent commander, he can be careless and hasty in other matters. Despite his name and somewhat fearsome military reputation, he strives to be a man of the people and involves himself in the lives of the commoners.
