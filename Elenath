Elenath: A prosperous country with extensive trade treaties. 
It is the largest country on the continent but most of their military is focused on the Navy. 
However, they have an alliance with Petroath which provides them safety should war break out. 
Elenath exports many metals (iron, silver, and gold), along with wheat, other food products, and fabrics including cotton and linen.
The royal family (half-elves) currently consists of King Fredrik, Queen Elaine (originally the younger sister of Queen Zoe of Qulorick), and their 3 children: 
Lucilla (currently banished for use of magic and location unknown), Eleanor (engaged to Duke Stoneheart), and Peter who is trading at the Malsagov school of swords. 
While the kingdom is considered one of the most progressive both in terms of invention and society, the royal family has a strict ban on use of magic within their royal line. 
They see it as tainting the power they carry through their physical beings.
