The Kingdom of Lashier is ruled by King Riv and his sister Queen Vir (nagaji) who are twins, aged 13. They recently took power and the country has fallen prey to Sorova, who after the civil war placed Lashier under heavy taxes and restrited access to the rest of the continent by land. It is mostly tundra and polar regions with heavy reliance on the sea and its bountys for food and trade. They also have a very powerful army and navy which is mostly untouched by Sorova.
