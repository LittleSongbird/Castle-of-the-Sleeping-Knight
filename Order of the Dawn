The Malsagovs stand as a revered and formidable family line of warriors, etching their legacy in the annals of history through dedication to their holy cause. 
Renowned not only for their unparalleled combat skills but also for their unbreakable bond as a family, The Malsagovs' prestigious and brutal training school stands as a crucible in which the next generation is forged into formidable warriors.
However, amid the brutality, the training school also fosters a sense of unity and shared purpose. 
As candidates face trials together, enduring the same hardships, they develop an unspoken bond that transcends mere camaraderie, embodying the spirit of the Malsagov lineage.

The school is separated into 2 side, magic and swords. 
When students attempt to enter the school, they are tested in both magical and physical abilities and while training may cross over, they primarily stay with one course. 
In addition, all students are trained in diplomacy, social ediquette, and advising techniqures. 
While the school has no stated loyalty to any kingdom, their students serve as advisors in most kingdoms, attempting both to maintain peace and treaties and prepare kingdoms for the potential of war, from within and without.


At the heart of the Malsagovs' legend lies Ania, the original warrior goddess who blazed the path for her descendants. 
Ania emerged as an extraordinary figure, marked by her unparalleled courage and strategic brilliance. 
Her mastery of celestial magic and swordsmanship was matched only by her innate ability to inspire those around her. 
So great was her commitment and faith that upon her death, she accended to godhood, becoming the goddess of war and peace. 
Because of her origins as a mortal, it is said that a desendant of hers might be born in every generation to lead the order and bring holy fire to darkness. 
While several desendants have been found in the past, there is none currently.
